          <h2>Medical student & Web Developer</h2>
          <p>
            I am a passionate medical student who began my studies in Ukraine,
            but due to the war, I relocated to Spain, where I am now based and
            continuing my education. As I approach the final year of my medical
            degree, I’ve discovered a new interest in web development, which has
            allowed me to explore my creativity and analytical skills from a
            different perspective.<br />
            <br />
            I’m excited about the potential to merge my medical background with
            my web development skills, aiming to create innovative solutions
            that can enhance healthcare delivery and patient care. As I work
            towards completing my studies in both fields simultaneously, I’m
            eager to explore how technology can transform the future of
            medicine.

              This project displays a multi-page, responsive website using CSS
              Grid and Flexbox. The project involved recreating a design for an
              e-commerce plant shop called “resume project ,” ensuring seamless
              navigation and responsiveness across various devices. I utilized
              CSS Grid for complex layouts and media queries for adaptability,
              while incorporating custom fonts and colors through CSS variables
              for a cohesive look. This project honed my skills in advanced CSS
              techniques and designing for an optimal user experience on both
              mobile and desktop platforms.

              I transformed a wireframe into a functional webpage, focusing on
              creating a cohesive color scheme, structured header, and a
              responsive layout using CSS Grid. I applied the :first-child

                    Participated in a comprehensive training program focused on
                    the development of both soft skills (such as communication
                    and teamwork) and hard skills (like technical proficiency).
